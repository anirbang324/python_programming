if we get error on executionpolicy-

open powershell by administrator:

Set-ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" -Scope Process -Confirm:$false

Set-ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false

This will set the execution policy for the given scope.

On executing "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List", we should now see the below:

MachinePolicy = RemoteSigned
UserPolicy       = Undefined
Process           = RemoteSigned
CurrentUser     = RemoteSigned
LocalMachine  = RemoteSigned
