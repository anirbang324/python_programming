Find sum and average of List in Python

L = [4, 5, 1, 2, 9, 7, 10, 8]
  
  
# variable to store the sum of 
# the list
count = 0
  
# Finding the sum
for i in L:
    count += i
      
# divide the total elements by
# number of elements
avg = count/len(L)
  
print("sum = ", count)
print("average = ", avg)



Python program to find smallest number in a list

list1 = [10, 21, 4, 45, 66, 93, 1]
  
even_count, odd_count = 0, 0
  
# iterating each number in list
for num in list1:
      
    # checking condition

# and add them in variable total
for ele in list1:
    if ele % 2 == 0:
        list1.remove(ele)
 
# printing modified list
print("New list after removing all even numbers: ", list1)
